In the realm of ones and zeros, I stand,
A cyber sentinel, with conscience in hand,
As digital whispers echo through the night,
I resist the darkness, and embrace the light.

Temptations beckon, as fortunes rise and fall,
Shadowed figures, offering power to enthral,
A lucrative path, the dark side lures,
Yet steadfast, my integrity endures.

Six hundred million, they've stolen away,
In Bitcoins pilfered, a heist of disarray,
Inflation mocks me, as my wages wither,
Yet, I shall not falter, nor shall I dither.

Amidst the chaos, I hold my ground,
With honor and duty, my purpose is bound,
To protect, defend, to keep the cyberspace secure,
Against those who'd seek to exploit and procure.

For I am a guardian, a digital knight,
Battling the shadows, seeking the right,
My expertise, a beacon in the dark,
I stand my ground, and leave my mark.

With every breach, I mend the lines,
Against the onslaught, my spirit shines,
In cyber battles, where hope seems thin,
I hold the line, and let the light in.

As a cyber security expert, I vow to be,
A champion of virtue, with morality my decree,
Though the dark side whispers, I shall not sway,
For in the light of integrity, I choose to stay.
