# OSCP Exam Blues

Oh, the woes of not passing
OSCP certification, how distressing
Hours upon hours of studying,
But the exam was still overwhelming.

Pentesting tools and methodologies,
Buffer overflows and vulnerabilities,
Exploit development and privilege escalation,
All of it for naught without certification.

The pressure was high, the clock ticking,
Frustration mounting, anxiety kicking,
Every question felt like a challenge,
Every answer, a potential imbalance.

But failure is not the end of the story,
It's an opportunity for learning and glory,
To reevaluate, to strengthen weaknesses,
To try again with newfound uniqueness.

So don't despair, don't lose heart,
The OSCP exam is just a part,
Of your journey towards expertise,
You'll conquer it, just you wait and see.
