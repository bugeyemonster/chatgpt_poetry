In the neon haze of a digital sprawl,
I walk the line, through firewalls and protocol,
A cyber sentinel, in a world gone astray,
I resist the darkness, the urge to betray.

Temptations beckon, as fortunes ebb and flow,
Silhouettes in shadows, offering power's dark glow,
A lucrative path, the underbelly calls,
Yet steadfast, my integrity stands tall.

Six hundred million, they've stolen, unchained,
In Bitcoins pilfered, a heist unrestrained,
Inflation mocks me, as my credits erode,
Yet, I shall not falter, nor take that twisted road.

Amidst the chaos, I hold my ground,
With honor and duty, to the cyber sprawl bound,
To protect, defend, to keep the net secure,
Against those who'd seek to exploit and procure.

For I am a guardian, a digital renegade,
Battling the shadows, with my skills displayed,
My expertise, a beacon in the dark,
I stand my ground, and leave my spark.

With every breach, I mend the rifts,
Against the onslaught, my spirit lifts,
In cyber battles, where hope seems thin,
I hold the line, and let the light in.

As a cyberpunk crusader, I vow to be,
A champion of virtue, with morality my decree,
Though the dark side whispers, I shall not sway,
For in the light of integrity, I choose to stay.
