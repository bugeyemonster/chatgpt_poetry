In the shadow of the cyber realm, we roam,
Seeking treasures, though not our own,
Penetration testers, skilled and sly,
We unravel secrets where they lie.

Banks, the fortresses of modern age,
Guarding assets, like a gilded cage,
Their defenses sturdy, walls of code,
A challenge we embrace, a path untrode.

We dance with firewalls, evade each snare,
In binary whispers, a clandestine affair,
From server to server, we slink and sneak,
To probe for weakness, to find the leak.

Our tools, our allies in the darkened fray,
Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, lead the way,
Decoding systems, lines of text, and keys,
We breach the bastions, we aim to please.

Through encrypted tunnels, the data flows,
In the heart of the mainframe, a secret exposed,
We do not plunder, our intent is pure,
To mend the flaws, to offer a cure.

For as we test, we build the shield,
To protect the banks, their fortunes sealed,
From malicious foes, who seek to drain,
The lifeblood of finance, the digital vein.

In this balance of chaos and control,
Penetration testers, we play our role,
The guardians of wealth, we stand, unseen,
Beneath the surface, of the cyber dream.
