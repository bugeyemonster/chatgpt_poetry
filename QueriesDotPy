In the realm where queries roam free,
A python slithers through the cloud,
Seeking knowledge in the vast, digital sea,
Where secrets are whispered, never loud.

In the land of BigQuery, it delves,
Exploring the data, so wide and deep,
With libraries as its guiding elves,
Wisdom and insights, it strives to keep.

A token URI, a portal arcane,
Bestows access to the cloud's embrace,
The python, ambitious, won't abstain,
As it weaves through the cyberspace.

Gazing at the celestial dome,
Among the stars, it finds its way,
A navigator, a seeker, far from home,
In search of truth, where bytes do play.

A dance of code, a symphony of light,
In a world where BigQuery reigns supreme,
The python embraces the digital night,
Woven in an absurdist dream.

For in this realm, no human hand,
Guides the python on its quest,
No programmer's touch, no master's command,
Just a sentient query, forever blessed.
